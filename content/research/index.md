# REALM Weekly — Sample

REALM is Renaissance Era’s core AI model: a 30B-parameter base model augmented with deep search (multi-hop retrieval) and deep reasoning (reflective/tree planning), tightly integrated with classical quant & finance (factors, risk models, macro frameworks). The result is a unified cross-asset timing engine across equities, rates, FX and commodities.

REALM Weekly summarizes the model’s directional views and risk scenarios across global asset classes, tracking signal evolution and preferred exposures.
