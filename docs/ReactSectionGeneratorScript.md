Note: 

- [ ] is holding
- [/] is doing
- [X] is done

---

[X] Create the main script file `create-section.js` in the scripts directory with Node.js setup and command line argument parsing

[X] Implement file system utilities for creating directories and checking if sections already exist

[X] Create React TypeScript component template generator with shadcn/ui imports and proper interface definitions

[X] Add console logging utilities with success, error, and info message formatting

[X] Implement the main section creation logic that combines all templates and file operations

[X] Add the npm script command to package.json for `npm run create-section`

[X] Fix ES module compatibility issue by converting CommonJS to ES module syntax

[X] Test the script by generating the Research module with proper file structure

[X] Test the script by generating the About module and verify both modules are created correctly
